# ngsLearn

I learn the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) tools with this project. Following materials with codes are included.

1. Basic command line and shell script to handle NGS data, i.e. bedtools, samtools, seqtk, and tabix so on.
2. RNA-Seq pipeline, i.e. aligner (bowtie2), splice junction identification (Tophat2), read count, differentially expressed gene analysis and visualization.
3. Exome-Seq pipeline, i.e. aligner (), GATK (), 
4. Chi-Seq pipeline
